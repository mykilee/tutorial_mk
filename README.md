# Introduction about datasets
# Information about the creator and source of datasets 
This dataset contains student achievement data for two Portuguese high schools.
The data was collected using school reports and questionnaires, and includes student grades, demographics, social, parent, and school-related features. Two datasets are provided regarding performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese language. I have cleaned the original datasets so that they are easier to read and use.
